1 Exploration

Explorationâ€”how agents discover actions that lead to high rewardsâ€”is a key component of reinforcement learning. In this homework, you will investigate count-based exploration methods that modify the reward function to encourage exploring novel parts of the state space:

RËœ(st) = R(st) + Î± Â· B(N(st)). (1)

N(st) represents the number of times the agent has visited the state, and the function B is a monotonically decreasing function of N(st), known as the exploration bonus. The intuition is that we would like to encourage the agent to visit novel states. If the state s is novel or is rarely visited, then N(s) will be low, and B(N(st)) will be high. Conversely, if the state s is visited often, then N(s) will be high, and B(N(st)) will be low. Therefore, the exploration bonus is an additional term to the reward function that encourages the agent to spend more time visiting novel states. The hyperparameter Î± indicates how much to reward novel states.

In the discrete case, we can use a histogram to keep track of the number of times the agent visited state s, so the histogram directly gives us N(st). However, when the state space is continuous, the probability of any two states being equal is 0, so we cannot simply tally the number of times weâ€™ve visited the state. Instead, we must fit a density model fÏ†(st) over the state space and derive the count N(st) from fÏ†. Intuitively, if similar states to st have been visited many times, then fÏ†(st) will be high.

Given Eqn. 1, you can then run your standard reinforcement learning algorithms with only a single additional step: computing B(N(st)) as your agent acts in the environment. To do this we need to keep a replay buffer R that stores the states the agent has visited so far (note that here we only store states, not entire transitions). In the discrete case, the histogram can take place of the replay buffer; in the continuous case, the replay buffer serves as the data distribution with which we will fit the density model fÏ†(st). The algorithm is summarized below:

There are many possible ways to specify B(N(st)). In this homework, for discrete states we will use

.

For continuous states we will use a heuristic bonus

B(N(st)) = âˆ’logfÏ†(st)

which skips computing N(st) but is still a function that decreases the more

states similar to st have been visited.

1.1 Discrete States

The purpose of this section is to focus on modifying the rewards with the exploration bonus without having to worry about fitting a density model. Therefore we will modify the rewards like so:

(2)

1.2 Continuous States

Now that we have implemented the framework for Algorithm 1 for discrete states, we will now replace the histogram with a replay buffer and a density model fÏ†, and our goal is to be able to compute fÏ†(s) for any state s such that we modify the rewards like so:

R0(s,a) = R(s,a) + Î±(âˆ’logfÏ†(s)) (3)

1.2.1 Non-parametric density estimation: kernel density estimation (KDE)

Kernel density estimation is a non-parametric method that estimates the density model by maintaining a dataset of all encountered states (the replay buffer R in our case and using a kernel function KÏ†(s1,s2) to measure the similarity between states.

Using an radial basis function kernel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_ basis_function_kernel), we can to estimate the density of a new datapoint s by plopping a Gaussian distribution centered around each of the datapoints in R, evaluate the probability of s under each of these Gaussians, and average these probabilities together (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_ density_estimation for some nice intuitive figures). Intuitively, if a lot of the datapoints in R are close together, then the probability density of nearby points are similar because each Gaussian contributes to the probability density of these points. In particular, for a given state s, we can estimate its probability density as

.

1.2.2 Parametric density estimation: exemplar models

The problem with kernel density estimators is that to every time we evaluate the probability of a point, we have to apply the kernel to every point in the replay buffer, which becomes computationally intensive with a large replay buffer. Alternatively, we can use a parametric density estimator, which does not require a full pass through all the data to compute probabilities, but this comes at the cost of training the density model from samples, which introduces another layer of approximation.

One way to estimate the probability density fÏ†(s) is to train a state-conditioned noisy discriminator Ds(s0) to output 1 if s = s0 and 0 if s 6= s0 (note that Ds is a discriminator conditioned on the exemplar s, so Ds and Ds0 are not the same). The output of the discriminator is the probability that a Bernoulli random variable y takes the value 1: p(y = 1|s,s0) := p(s = s0). Then we can estimate fÏ†(s) by evaluating Ds on its own state s:

(4)

the reasoning behind which you can find here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703. 01260. With this discriminator, we can estimate a probability density model over the states weâ€™ve seen before (in the replay buffer) by training the discriminator to distinguish between exemplar states s and the states s0 from the replay buffer. Intuitively, if Ds(s0) is high, then this means that s is easily distinguished from states s0 in R, which means the probability is low that a state similar to s is in R, in which case fÏ†(s) is low. Conversely, if states similar to s are very common in R, then the Ds will have a hard time distinguishing s and s0, in which case Ds(s0) will output a value close to 0.5, which would make fÏ†(s) high.

To illustrate this, letâ€™s consider an environment with states A, B for simplicity. Assume following two scenarios:

Scenario 1 Scenario 2

New batch of data A A

Replay Buffer B,B,B,B A,A,B,B

In Scenario 1, A is a novel state, whereas in Scenario 2 it is not. In EX2 we use examples from the new batch of data as positives and examples from the replay buffer as negatives. In Scenario 1, DA would get perfect accuracy and output 1, whereas in Scenario 2, DA would output 0.5. By plugging these values in Equation 4 one can see that in Scenario 1, fÏ†(A) = 0 is low, meaning that this is a new state, and in Scenario 2, fÏ†(A) = 1 is high, meaning that this state has been seen before.

Letting s1 := s and s2 := s0 for clarity, the discriminator can be viewed as a graphical model decomposed as:

p(y|s1,s2) = Ez1âˆ¼qz1|s1,z2âˆ¼qz2|s2 [p(y|z1,z2)q1(z1|s1)q2(z2|s2)]

where z are latent Gaussian random variables and y is a Bernoulli variable. The zâ€™s introduce noise in the discriminator to prevent it from overfitting and encourage it to assign similar probability density to similar states. The discriminator is trained to maximize the following objective:

where

KL := Î² (DKL (q(z1|s1)||p(z1)) + DKL (q(z2|s2)||p(z2)))

and where p(z) is a multivariate standard Gaussian, Î² is a weighting coefficient that controls how much the discriminator overfits (tries to maximize the log likelihood more) or underfits (tries to make the latent distribution as close to a standard Gaussian as possible), and p(Ëœs) is the data distribution the discriminator is trained on, which contains half exemplar states and half replay-buffer states.
